# YouTube Video Search Python Program
Search for YouTube Videos Using Python 

I was wondering how I could use Python to search for videos on YouTube without having to do it myself.

And it was pretty simple!

That‚Äôs one of the things I love about Python, it allows you to create programs quickly and with just a few lines of code.

### Let's begin...

1. Import the following packages
- urllib.request 

urllib.request will be used to get the HTML for the search results page on YouTube and print its HTML.

- re

re if for regular expression. You can find more details about this module [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=re#module-re)

- webbrowser

This module is used to open links in a default browser. And it will be useful in opening our generated 
search link in our browser

- random

used to randomly generate youtube link 

## This program come is two format, 
- search.py and
- search.ipynb
So you choose the one you want. Both implement same functionality

 ## How to run both files
To run `search.py`, make sure you have lastest Python 3 installed and 
- run `python search.py`
To run `search.ipynb`, make sure you have jupyter notebook installed and
- run it using their kernel

With that said, enjoy using this program.
